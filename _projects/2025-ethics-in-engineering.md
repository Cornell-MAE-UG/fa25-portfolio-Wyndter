Project Overview:
Over the Fall 2025 semester, we were tasked with critically analyzing the Boeing 737 Max Crash Disaster from all possible perspectives. We considered who was at fault and who was a victim, and we spent much time deliberating over which people in the vague gray area belonged in which category. Throughout this analysis process, we learned much about the

Identifying Ethical Issues:
Overall we asked many questions to ourselves to help narrow down what sources of ethical blame we can assign to different groups of people. And we asked these questions to eventually help derive what should have happened.

Narrowing the Focus:
The questions we asked are as follows: Should Boeing engineers and managers be able to bypass regulations and safety checks in order to speed up results? Should Boeing be allowed to release an unsafe design it it makes them money? Should a negligent company be open to massive investments? Should Boeing be allowed to recruit more engineers before fixing internal issues? Should a company be allowed to regulate itself?

Determining Relevant Facts:


Making Reasonable Assumptions:


Identifying Practical Constraints:
To answer the question of whether Boeing engineers should be able to bypass regulations and safety checks, we can consider the organizational pressure, the (lack of) job security, and the regulatory ambiguity which afflects them. Engineers might be highly incentivized to fasttrack their progress, so that their projects are completed quicker and theur subteams remain on schedule. In addition, Boeing engineers might lose their jobs to people who can accomplish similar goals in shorter timeframes, meaning that there is an incentive for engineers to operate faster than they should, in order to maintain importance. Finally, the FAA created unclear and incomplete regulations which may allow for engineers to technically meet all the available requirements without ensuring safety due to how quickly they created a solution. While considering all of these aspects, we understand why individual engineers may fast track their work, however there is no excuse for Boeing and upper management to allow their employees to do this with zero regard for human safety.

Conclusion:
Overall,
