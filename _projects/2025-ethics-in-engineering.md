Project Overview:
Over the Fall 2025 semester, we were tasked with critically analyzing the Boeing 737 Max Crash Disaster from all possible perspectives. We considered who was at fault and who was a victim, and we spent much time deliberating over which people in the vague gray area belonged in which category. Throughout this analysis process, we learned much about the

Identifying Ethical Issues:
Overall we asked many questions to ourselves to help narrow down what sources of ethical blame we can assign to different groups of people. And we asked these questions to eventually help derive what should have happened.

Narrowing the Focus:
The questions we asked are as follows: Should Boeing engineers and managers be able to bypass regulations and safety checks in order to speed up results? Should Boeing be allowed to release an unsafe design it it makes them money? Should a negligent company be open to massive investments? Should Boeing be allowed to recruit more engineers before fixing internal issues? Should a company be allowed to regulate itself?

Determining Relevant Facts:
We also must consider the relevant facts of each situation and make reasonable assumptions based on the facts that are missing. The key themes which we want to consider are the decision-making process, individual awareness, organizational culture, technical alternatives, regulatory processes, and financial factors.

Undertaking Definitional Clarification:
We then worked on understanding the values which lay within terminology (e.g. "good," "bad," "just," "unjust"). Before we can make ethical judgements about what happened, we needed to clarify what we mean by these key terms. For example, Boeing defines the term "transparency" as meeting legal obligations by supplying technically accurate information to regulators, regardless of the understanding of stakeholders. If transparency just means compliance, then engineers defer to their hierarchy and the industry self-regulation continues. But if transparency is defined publically and ethically, then engineers must independently uphold safety regulations which require public accountability to shift toward deeper changes in corporate responsibility.


Identifying Practical Constraints:
To answer the question of whether Boeing engineers should be able to bypass regulations and safety checks, we can consider the organizational pressure, the (lack of) job security, and the regulatory ambiguity which afflects them. Engineers might be highly incentivized to fasttrack their progress, so that their projects are completed quicker and theur subteams remain on schedule. In addition, Boeing engineers might lose their jobs to people who can accomplish similar goals in shorter timeframes, meaning that there is an incentive for engineers to operate faster than they should, in order to maintain importance. Finally, the FAA created unclear and incomplete regulations which may allow for engineers to technically meet all the available requirements without ensuring safety due to how quickly they created a solution. While considering all of these aspects, we understand why individual engineers may fast track their work, however there is no excuse for Boeing and upper management to allow their employees to do this with zero regard for human safety.

Conclusion:
Overall, Many facets of the broader system that makes up Boeing must change in order to prevent massive catastrophes like the 737 Max disaster from reoccuring. Every person who works at Boeing is complicit in some way, while certain groups such as the upper management and the lead engineers share the largest portion of the blame. Ultimately passenger, client, and citizen safety should be the top priority for Boeing at all times, not the money, not efficiency, and not turnaround time. Every employee of Boeing has the responsibility of keeping each other in check, and there should be additional regulations hammered into the system of Boeing from outsiders, since self regulation is no longer an option for Boeing.
