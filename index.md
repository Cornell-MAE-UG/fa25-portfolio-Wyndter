My name is William Natcharian, and I am a senior studying Mechanical Engineering and History at Cornell University. I am working toward a concentration in Environmental Engineering, I am an active member of the Armenian Student Organization (ASO) here, and I am the former Treasurer of the Cornell Mafia Club!

In my free time I enjoy Rock Climbing, Reading, Hiking, Sketching, Gardening, Poker, and Music
